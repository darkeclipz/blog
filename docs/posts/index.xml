      <description>In this post we will look at solving Project Euler&amp;rsquo;s problem #71, which is about ordered fractions. I have been puzzling with pen and paper for a while during this problem, and researching about fractions really paid off big time for this problem. The final solution is pretty elegant in my opinion. Let&amp;rsquo;s get into it!
Problem statement#Consider the fraction $n / d$, where $n$ and $d$ are positive integers.</description>

      <description>In this post we will look at solving problem 81 on Project Euler. This problem is about finding a minimal path sum in a matrix. There are three variants of this problem, and this is the easiest one.
Problem statement#In the 5 by 5 matrix below, the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right, by only moving to the right and down, is indicated in bold red and is equal to 2427.</description>

      <title>Totient maximum</title>

      <description>In this post we will look at solving problem 69 on Project Euler. This problem is about using Euler&amp;rsquo;s totient function to find a given maximum. Without any further introduction, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into it.
Problem statement#Euler&amp;rsquo;s Totient function, $\varphi(n)$, is used to determine the number of numbers less than $n$ which are relatively prime to $n$. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine, and relatively prime to nine, $\varphi(9) = 6$.</description>

      <description>Introduction#A few years ago I have written a detailed analysis of the probabilities in Monopoly. However, because of handwaving many rules to make it easier to analyze, I wanted to redo it and use all the rules this time. The main motivation for doing this is to solve a question on Project Euler. While we are at it, I also wanted to take the time to answer a few different questions as well.</description>

      <title>Compartment model for epidemiology</title>

      <description>This post looks at a compartment model for epidemiology and analyzes the different relationships between the variables in the model. Finally, it draws conclusions about the impact the variables have on the model.
SEIRD-model#The population is divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual has the same characteristics. There are a total of five compartments:
Susceptible ($S$) Exposed ($E$) Infected ($I$) Recovered ($R$) Diseased ($D$) The population flows in the following direction between the compartments.</description>
