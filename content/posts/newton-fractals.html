<p>
    Another interesting set of fractals, are Newton fractals.
    Newton fractals are created by applying Newton's method to complex function $f(z)$. The method uses the iterated equation
    
    $$
        z_{n+1} = z - \frac{f(z_n)}{f'(z_n)}.
    $$
    
    If we want to apply Newton's method, we also need to find the derivative of the function $f(z)$.
    Since Newton's method is used to find the zero's of a function, if we repeatedly apply it to a point $z$, then $f(z_{n\rightarrow\infty}) = 0$, meaning that every point converges to a root of the complex function. 
    Although the points usually converge to a root, it is also possible that is orbit cyclic.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Suppose we have the function $f(z) = z^3 - 1$, then the derivative is $f'(z) = 3z^2$. This function has three roots.
    If we apply Newton's method for all the points in the plane $[-1, 1]\times[-1, 1]$, then each of these points will end up at one of those three roots.
    We can then visualize the result by giving the resulting pixel value a color based on the root it ended up at. 
    In this case the color is determined by looking at the angle of the root, and then get a color from a color map. 
    The color map used in this example is <code>hsv2rgb(angle + 0.1, 1, 1)</code>.

    It took a few attempts to get this image. The silliest mistake I made was using a function that has only 1, or 2 roots. This simply results in an image with only one, or two colors.

  <h2>Relaxed Newton's method</h2>
  
  <p>
  It is possible to modify the method by multiplying with a relaxation parameter $R$. 
  This real number is used to increase/decrease the step size. 
  The relaxed Newton's method is
  
  $$  
    z_{n+1} = z_n - R\cdot\frac{f(z_n)}{f'(z_n)}.
  $$
    
  If we then let the value of R animate between $[0.2, 2.2]$, we can see what the effect of this relaxation parameter is.

  <h2>Generalized Newton's method</h2>
  <p>
    Another thing that can be done is to generalize the method by it multiplying with a complex number $a$, instead of using the real relaxation parameter:
    
    $$
        z_{n+1} = z_n - a\cdot\frac{f(z_n)}{f'(z_n)}.
    $$
    
    If we then let $\Re(z)$ and $\Im(z)$ animate between the values $[-1, 1]$, in this case with a Lissajous curve, we can see the effect $a$ has on the method.

  <h2>Using a different color map</h2>
  
  <p>
    Instead of using the HSV color map, which gives us a rainbow based on the angle of the complex number, we are going to look at the magnitude of the complex number, which is $|z|$. We will also use the magma color map from matplotlib, which is <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WlfXRN" target="_blank">created by Mattz and available on ShaderToy</a>. I have slightly modified the color map, because I wanted it to wrap at the edges, instead of having a discontinuity.

  <p>
    Because we want to loop our color map, we will only use the fractional part of $|z|$. The following image is the Newton fractals rendered with the color map.
